    <p> In this video my group and I worked on a production for a semester in our Senior Year of high school. This film trailer won us the Best Picture award in our school our of the 100 other students participating.</p>
    <p> Another activity I throughly enjoyed in this class was using photoshop to create protraits and other pieces of art one of which got to be an exhibit in the Museum of Design here in Chicago.</p>

    <h2>Why I Chose My Major: Game Production Management</h2>
    <p>Growing up, my main source of joy was games, whether that meant board games, video games, or sports. They were a constant part of my life, shaping how I learned, connected with others, and expressed creativity. When I reached high school, I had the opportunity to explore this passion more deeply through the Game Programming branch of the Computer Science program, where I began to see how games could combine both logic and imagination.</p>
    <p>As I studied games, I explored the many ways they impact people’s lives, and one area that stood out to me was their educational and medical potential. When most people think about games, they often focus on the negatives, such as addiction or distraction, without realizing the benefits that games can provide. In reality, games can be powerful tools for learning, therapy, and stress relief. When you think about it, without games of any kind, whether digital or physical, many people wouldn’t have an outlet to unwind, express themselves, or process challenges in a healthy way.</p>
